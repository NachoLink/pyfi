    "The hardest part about doing financial workloads in Python is that their Excel spreadsheets are not formatted for data science. Here are some of the specific issues that make it hard for Fin groups to use Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Data is not Tidy:* Excel spreadsheets are formatted for presentation not data science. People include blank lines and cells to make the sheets look pretty. But data science (Python and all the BI tools) expects data to be in Tidy Format. Tidy data conforms to three rules: \n",
    "    * Each variable must have its own column.\n",
    "    * Each observation must have its own row.\n",
    "    * Each value must have its own cell.\n",
    "* *No transparency:* Excel spreadsheets don’t have comments making it hard to trace back why certain transformations occurred. In Python all transformations can be commented to allow for greater transparency.\n",
    "* *No single source of truth:* Excel spreadsheets rarely connect to a source of record. Instead, they pull values from other spreadsheets using Power Query or other tools. Tracing back all the occasions for a cell is very difficult.\n",
    "* *Different date standards:* Some Python work loads use work weeks instead of dates. This is an issue because there are multiple standards one could use to align work weeks to dates. Data science algortithms usually expect dates to be in a standard DateTime format. \n",
